# Cinemalytics - Create your own movie database

## About Cinemalytics
During lockdown I became quite obsessed with watching new films, with the sheer number of films I was watching I got curious...

- _Which actor had I seen the most?_
- _How many films have I seen this month?_
- _Have I ever seen a film released in 1980?_

Here came the idea for Cinemalytics, a place where you can keep a list of films you watch that stores every detail of each film. 
So you can get intricate data on your watching habbits.

## How does it work?
Using the [**Cinemagoer** (formerly IMDBpy)]([https://pages.github.com/](https://cinemagoer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) Python module, Cinemalytics can fetch all relevant data on films. 
Such as:
- Cast
- Composer(s)
- Director(s)
- Release Year
- Genre(s)
- Runtimes
- IMDb rating


### Chronilogical Film List 
Each time you add a film you will be asked a series of comparison
