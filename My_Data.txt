Best Day of Paris. Went to the PSG stadium and went around the grounds. Did a post match interview and missed 2 penalties against Kit. Then went to Eiffel Tower. Was a good time. Then onto a snooker club, I beat Kit 3 games to 2. Went to the best cheapest Japanese restaurant in Paris. Then on the way back we wandered, stumbled across an ammusement park right in the center did the "paris eye" just as the eiffel tower lit up at night. Then won Louis a Neymar Lighter shooting cans with a rifle, perfect end to the holiday. C'est bon.

Super romantic. When we got back we impromptu recorded two songs completely improvised and very intoxicated. It was amazing.

My birthday, spent the whole day with Imogen. Had a 5 aside tournement game and I scored the winning goal at the end of the game by nutsing the keeper after an assist from Sam our keeper, Kick of glitch. Amazing feeling, we were all so gassed went to the anchor to celebrate. Benji got me and Imo a baby guinness for my birthday so we names our morning after baby "baby guinness". Watched liverpool Madrid while me and imogen played pool. 2-0 at 15 minutes, then madrid came back 2-5 amaizing. Imogen potted the black. We then went bowling, we both won a game but I was impressed. We just walked around for an hour before coming back and having some pretty amazing sex. Life is good. I'm 22.
2023/02/22
Me and Marcus met up and created the boneworks for our board game it now is playable and we get along well. Got my bike fixed. Got a prostate exam... Not very fun but at least i dont have cancer.

Came back to mine, blowjob and a twirl

Bit hungover. Went to work. Rosies freinds Ollie Millie and Will came in and got me a drink. Then got verbally abused by a mental guy. He'd been rude to everyone on shift and asked me if he was rude. I said ye mate its probably your tone of voice. he flipped and got so mad literally started frothing from the mouth. Stood my ground and kept smiling. Properly got in my face and smelt quite bad, fun way to end a shift.

Open Mic shift, got up and played WIsh you were here and it went really well had the whole crowd singing, then some drunk scottish guy got on stage and kept asking me to play random songs until he was heckled off. Lost my grove after that. Grace from Marketgate came in with her bf on her anniversary. Hadnt seen her in years was nice but a bit awkward. Imogen came in just after a hippie night with Tash. Saw Tom and Yeomans on king street too. They all came in and sung me happy birthday as it turned midnight. Got a shot of fireball. Drinking ban basically over...

    DREAMS:
2022/01/05
Was climbing a mountain to start, like playing red dead redemption/halo infinite riding horses with auntie sarah and mum and rosie. In that same world I was cliff diving for ages and was suprised to see Tom Jefferies for some reason I was happy to see him but I knew Louis was behind the suprise, he was and he bought loads of my freinds cliff diving. Billie eilish was diving and she didn't land perfectly so i convinced someone to leave a bad review. Next I was captain america/master chief with a grapple hook. I went to do a boss battle and got to play the piano in the waiting room. Then I had to battle red skull who fucked me up and knocked my teeth out i pretended to die so hed leave me alone. Then daredevil came in and told me to be quiet, when I got up I stole all his batteries for my electric razer and controllers and left. Mum was behind it she had invited all my enemies over including Trevor Phillips i never found out why. Then Kevin Hart died and i watched his memorial with lots of celebrities and it was really really sad. 
2022/01/09
I was in a movie about 12 people on trial, I was playing someone in a wheelchair so i couldn't use my legs and was used in a lot of no legs gags. Mac Miller was cast in the movie even though I knew he would dead. I managed to convince him to give me some of his weed, I put a picture of that on his subreddit and got a lot of upvotes. Then i was in Dane John and there was this guy selling bikes on a hill and bragging about how they never got stolen, it was plant boss I think. I stole a bike and rode it far away but he followed me I figured out he had me on FindMyPhone so I uninstalled it. Then it was Chrismas eve and me and Gabe were in HMV we ran though with hoods up so we didnt have to talk to them but they thought we were stealing so they called the police but we ran. Then on Christmas day I was going to go out with Kits family becacuse Aitch was gonna be with them but instead i spent it with Tom Rhys and SUman. I was in charge of the oven.

I won a competition so Neymar came round my house (Mums house). I had a big mural of him on my wall and he appriciated it, I also had a female Neymar doll that I showed him and he wasn't impressed. After he left I was mad that I never took a picture with him and then started to believe I had imagined it all.
2022/01/22
I was out at night with Tom by a rail track, I was really thirsty in real life because I came back from a party and hadn't drank water. On the tracks I saw a bottle of Prime: the KSI Logan Paul drink, probably because I was so thirsty in real life. I picked it up and saw another one, they clearly had left a trail for a promotional thing, I followed the trail picking them all up but kept dropping them. I train came but there was nobody in it so I kept collecting even though I dropped some under the train. The trail ended at a wallet, I picked it up and put it in my bag but I never found out what was inside because I was woken up by a call from a random landline number from canterbury.
2022/03/23
Went to Manils house and it was well classy and had an double ultrawide 4k TV.
2022/08/19
I dreamed I was playing football with a load of rappers. Kanye, Jay Z and I think Dave Chappelle was there. But I had the ability to slow down time when I was on the ball so I was OP. Scored so many good goals and also had superhuman jumping abilities. At the end Kanye was defending agaisnt me and in a playful way he squared up to me, i squared up back to him and he let out a crazy Kanye laugh and I patted him on the back and laughed with him, then Kit woke me up (in Paris).
2023/03/22
Post Malone came round and started singing in the shower downstairs, while he was singning max verwijs called me incredibly wasted and asked me to cover his shift that day. I told him I wasnt in canterbury, i didnt even know what his job was. Then everyone I was with left and all got seperate ubers but some people I knew said I should come to a party. One of those people was MC Grindah and I was with beats so I told them to share an uber. Then everyone was waiting for the ubers by a ditch, we joked about pushing people into the ditch. Jokingly I pushed lucas lightly towards the ditch, he stumbled and fell in and hit his head. He was passed out and I was worried he was dead. When he woke up he was so pissed off and tried to punch me. He said he was only temporarily mad at me becasue his head was already hurting. I told him you could have 3 free shots at my head to make up for it, he agreed and people started filming. I slipped all 3 punches.
2023/05/03
I was in Beta Squad and was filming a video where we played this board game featuring Joe Weller. Chunkz kept mocking me for not knowing the rules and I was always being made fun of for being the only white guy. I could slightly fly but only a bit (important for later) then I was at bear pit with Doug Oliver and we saw a load of small gremlin zombies Hundreds. They had really horrible mouths with sharp teeth and were mauling people so I got in a random taxi and we drove away. Got to a police station and used my flying abilities to get to the top. I looked down and there were thousands and they were about to get to me so I jumped off may as well die from fall damage. Felt the fall. But as always paused when I landed and went into spectator mode. So I reveresed time and went to see where imogen was when this all went down she was at old duke but I couldnt find it.
2023/07/29
I was in a game of black ops 2. I was killing so many people but they werent very good, I didnt die once. Then I was in a civization in the Last of Us world where humans had come to a point where it was safe. Then a man came running up to everyone and said the zombies were coming. Noone knew what to do and were very scared, I managed to jump on a train just in time. I still had a drone killstreak from black ops 2 so I used it on the train to look at what was happening in the civilization. People couldnt do anything except stand very still while a massive horde of zombies walked through the city, everyone was terrified. People had to stay extremely still. One guy couldnt take it and tried to run, he was eaten immediately and also fucked it up for everyone else. It was a graphic massicre. I saw a woman and her daughter running away into this building and I couldnt follow them anymore. So I used my spiderman powers to find them
2023/09/13
Had to deliver a comedic lecture about false promises in under 10 minutes to people I didnt know. Didn't go very well b ut I noticed Zinchenko was in the audience, spudded him then carried on. After we chatted for a while and I got a picture with him. After this I was in some kind of boot camp, loads of us were lined up in lines in a courtyard where we had to wait for our turn to kill ourselves to go into the next life. I was with kit in line. Didn't have much time to contemplate what was going on but when it was my turn I died and got reincarnated into a Pewdiepie lets play and I was playing Skyrim. I was put half way into the game though and I forgot what all my items did. Strange one.
